Before moving to Heidelberg, he was an Independent Fellow at the Laboratory of Systems Pharmacology at Harvard Medical School and the Klarman Cell Observatory at the Broad Institute where he was a a Damon Runyon Quantitative Biology Fellow mentored by Prof. Peter Sorger and Prof. Aviv Regev. Previously, he was supported by the SNFS Mobility Fellowship.
Denis obtained his PhD from the University of Zurich and ETH Zurich in the laboratory of Prof. Bernd Bodenmiller where he worked on Imaging Mass Cytometry and corresponding analysis tools focusing on highly multiplexed image analysis. Denis is the lead developer of the histology topography cytometry analysis toolbox (histoCAT) and the multiple choice microscopy pipeline (MCMICRO).
Prior to this, he received his diploma (Dipl. Biol. (t.o)) at the University of Stuttgart and Harvard Medical School working with Prof. Peter Sorger and Prof. Alfred Goldberg. He was also an intern at the Complex Systems Modeling Group at Bayer AG in Leverkusen focusing on PBPK modeling.
